To-Do List Manager

This Python program allows users to manage a simple task list directly from the terminal.
You can add new tasks, view all saved tasks, complete selected tasks and exit the program when finished.

It is designed as a beginner-friendly project for practicing lists, loops, conditional logic and user input handling.
